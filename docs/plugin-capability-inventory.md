# Plugin Capability Inventory

This report inventories the currently included plugins staged in `plugins/` and maps their observed behavior to Slopsmith capability domains. It is intended to inform the capability roadmap and the next migration specs after the audio graph/session slice.

## Scope And Method

- Inventory source: 41 `plugin.json` manifests under `plugins/`.
- Verification pass: 25 plugins include backend `routes.py`; 14 plugins include `settings.html`.
- No included plugin currently declares a manifest `capabilities` field, so every domain assignment below is an inferred or recommended declaration, not a current declaration.
- Manifest fields such as `nav`, `screen`, `settings`, `routes`, and `type: "visualization"` were treated as high-confidence evidence.
- Code patterns such as `window.slopsmithViz_*`, `window.playSong` wrappers, `window.showScreen` wrappers, `window.registerShortcut`, `window.slopsmithTour.register`, `window.slopsmith.audio.registerFader`, `highway.setNoteStateProvider`, and route/WebSocket handlers were treated as behavior evidence.

## Roadmap Baseline

The current roadmap already covers several surfaces implied by the plugin set:

| Roadmap State | Domains |
|---------------|---------|
| Active PR1 domains | `pipeline`, `diagnostics`, `library` |
| Audio graph/session slice | `audio-mix`, `audio-input`, `audio-monitoring`, `stems` |
| Planned UI domains | `ui.navigation`, `ui.plugin-screens`, `ui.player-controls`, `ui.player-panels`, `ui.player-overlays`, `settings` |
| Planned player/runtime domains | `playback`, `visualization`, `note-detection`, `midi-control`, `tempo-clock` |
| Planned privileged domains | `backend.routes`, `plugins`, `jobs` |

The plugin inventory confirms these planned domains are directionally right. The main gaps are additional domain names or command scopes for library card injection, guided tours, keyboard shortcuts, media import/export, recording/capture, audio effects, practice/session scoring, external services, and collaboration.

## Executive Summary

- The most common plugin surface is a plugin screen backed by optional routes and settings. `ui.plugin-screens`, `backend.routes`, and `settings` should be treated as first-class migration targets.
- Player integrations are heavily legacy-global today. `playback`, `ui.player-overlays`, `ui.player-controls`, `ui.player-panels`, and `visualization` need lifecycle and ordering contracts before wrappers can be retired.
- The audio domains promoted by the audio graph/session slice match real plugin behavior, but `audio-mix` still needs an executable fader control plane before `window.slopsmith.audio.registerFader` can become compatibility-only.
- Long-running work is spread across conversion, update, import, preview, and studio plugins. The `jobs` domain should include progress, cancellation, terminal failure, and provider attribution.
- Several plugins perform privileged or externally mediated work: subprocesses, downloads, native audio bridges, plugin updates, and media conversion. These should stay out of broad capability activation until each surface has user confirmation, diagnostics redaction, and failure recovery.

## Operation And Event Gaps

### High Priority

| Domain | Missing Or Under-Specified Surface |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| `audio-mix` | Add executable fader commands: `list-faders`, `get-fader-value`, `set-fader-value`, `inspect-route`, and `inspect-analyser`. Add provider operations `fader.get-value`, `fader.set-value`, `route.get-current`, and `analyser.get-summary` with committed value payloads and failure outcomes. Emit `fader-registered`, `fader-unregistered`, `fader-value-changed`, `fader-set-failed`, and `route-changed`. |
| `playback` | Replace wrapper chains with `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `seek`, `snapshot`, `audio-element`, `loop-set`, `loop-clear`, `loop-get`, `speed-set`, and `speed-get`. Emit song lifecycle, transport state, seek, speed, loop, and audio-element-ready events. |
| `jobs` | Add `register-provider`, `enqueue`, `list`, `inspect`, `cancel`, `pause`, `resume`, and `retry`. Emit `queued`, `started`, `progress`, `log`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and `provider-unavailable`. |
| `note-detection` | Add provider registration, active provider selection, note-state provider lifecycle, input binding, hit/miss/state events, calibration diagnostics, and performance-data redaction. |

### Medium Priority

| Domain | Missing Or Under-Specified Surface |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| `ui.plugin-screens` | Define contribution registration, mount/unmount, visibility, focus, navigation, teardown, and rehydration policy. |
| `ui.player-overlays` | Define surface, anchor, z-order, visibility, teardown, hit-testing, and renderer compatibility flags. |
| `ui.player-panels` | Define panel registration, per-panel renderer state, focus, shortcut scope, layout constraints, and teardown. |
| `ui.player-controls` | Define ordered contribution regions, command buttons, popovers, sliders, disabled states, and conflict policy. |
| `visualization` | Formalize provider registration, `contextType`, `matchesArrangement`, `panelControls`, per-panel selection, fallback/revert events, and renderer failure diagnostics. |
| `media-import-export` | Add import/export job requests, accepted file types, source trust metadata, generated artifact paths, and cleanup/failure semantics. |
| `audio-input` | Add enumerate/open/close source operations, source-selected/source-unavailable events, permission-denied state, and redacted device identity. |
| `audio-monitoring` | Add monitoring start/stop/status, native monitor mute, audio startup barrier status, failed/unavailable/degraded events, and safe input-level summaries. |
| `audio-effects` | Add effect-chain registration, model/IR inventory, preset load/save, parameter get/set, bypass, and native bridge availability events. |

### Lower Priority Or Cross-Cutting

| Domain | Missing Or Under-Specified Surface |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| `settings` | Add settings contribution metadata, export/import participation, settings schema hints, redaction class, and per-plugin backup diagnostics. |
| `plugins` | Add install/enable/disable/update commands with user confirmation, rollback, disabled-handler enforcement, and desktop bridge failure recovery. |
| `midi-control` | Add device enumerate/open/close, message send/listen, mapping registration, consent, and redacted diagnostics. |
| `tempo-clock` | Add tempo provider registration, BPM/time-signature changes, beat events, metronome tick state, and consumer subscription. |
| `keyboard-shortcuts` | Add shortcut contribution registration, scope, conflict resolution, enable/disable, and help-panel metadata. |
| `tours` | Add tour registration, eligibility, start/stop, step lifecycle, target resolution, and screen navigation dependency declarations. |
| `ui.library-card-injection` | Add card action registration, placement, enabled/disabled state, per-provider applicability, and action-result events. |
| `recording` | Add arm/start/stop capture, take upload/import, latency metadata, capture-source binding, and storage cleanup. |
| `practice-session` | Add session start/stop, goal registration, score/progress events, chart segment focus, and journal persistence boundaries. |
| `collaboration` | Add room/session lifecycle, participant identity redaction, shared playback sync, conflict policy, and disconnect recovery. |

## Audio Domain Notes

The audio graph/session slice should stay scoped to session coordination and redaction-safe diagnostics. This inventory reinforces three follow-up requirements:

1. `audio-mix` needs a control plane before the current mixer registry can be replaced. `registerFader()` still owns live callbacks and UI rendering today; the capability layer only records participants and bridge hits.
2. `stems` should remain coordinated by core but owned by the active Stems provider. Stem playback, mute/restore semantics, availability, and per-stem state belong to the provider.
3. `audio-input` and `audio-monitoring` should cover both browser and Desktop/native paths without leaking raw device labels, source ids, or capture details in diagnostics.

## Recommended Roadmap Updates

1. Add a focused `005-audio-mix-control-plane` spec for executable fader operations, provider operation handlers, mixer UI migration, and compatibility wrapper removal gates.
2. Promote `playback` soon after audio-mix. It is the widest legacy wrapper surface and affects visualizers, overlays, tones, metronome, splitscreen, and practice tools.
3. Promote `jobs` before migrating converter/import/update/studio routes. It gives privileged backend work a shared cancellation/progress/error model.
4. Promote `note-detection` as its own sensitive provider domain. It touches audio input, monitoring, visualization feedback, calibration, and diagnostics.
5. Create a UI contribution host spec that includes `ui.navigation`, `ui.plugin-screens`, `ui.player-controls`, `ui.player-overlays`, `ui.player-panels`, `keyboard-shortcuts`, and possibly `tours`.
6. Add missing candidate domains or safety inventories for `media-import-export`, `recording`, `audio-effects`, `practice-session`, `collaboration`, `ui.library-card-injection`, and `external-services`.

## Suggested Manifest Direction

When these plugins migrate, manifests should describe intent even before runtime handlers hydrate. For example, a visualization plugin might declare:

```json
{
  "standards": ["capability-pipelines.v1", "plugin-runtime-idempotent.v1"],
  "capabilities": {
    "visualization": {
      "roles": ["provider"],
      "operations": ["renderer.create", "renderer.destroy", "renderer.inspect"],
      "emits": ["renderer-ready", "renderer-failed"],
      "mode": "optional",
      "compatibility": "legacy-window-shim",
      "safety": "safe"
    }
  }
}
```

An audio plugin that participates in the active audio-session domains should declare requester/provider relationships more explicitly:

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "audio-mix": {
      "roles": ["provider"],
      "operations": ["fader.get-value", "fader.set-value"],
      "emits": ["fader-value-changed"],
      "mode": "active",
      "compatibility": "legacy-window-shim",
      "safety": "safe"
    },
    "stems": {
      "roles": ["requester", "observer"],
      "requests": ["mute", "restore", "inspect"],
      "observes": ["owner-available", "automation-applied", "automation-restored", "automation-overridden", "claim-orphaned"],
      "mode": "active",
      "compatibility": "none",
      "safety": "safe"
    }
  }
}
```

The exact command names should follow the spec that promotes each domain. Until then, these examples are direction markers rather than current contracts.

## Validation Notes

This report should be revisited after the Stems, NAM, audio engine, and other first-party plugins adopt manifest capability declarations. At that point, this document can separate current declarations from inferred legacy behavior and can become a migration checklist instead of an inventory.
