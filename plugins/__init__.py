    Plugin ids are opaque manifest values that can take reverse-DNS
    forms (`com.example.foo`) or contain other characters that
    Python's import machinery interprets specially — most
    importantly `.`, which it treats as a package boundary.

    The encoding is **bijective** so distinct plugin_ids always map
    to distinct encoded strings (otherwise two installed plugins
    could share a cache-key prefix and reintroduce the cross-plugin
    collision this PR is fixing). To make `_<hex>_` sequences in
    the output ONLY appear as a result of intentional escapes, the
    underscore is encoded first:

      `_` → `_5f_`   (hex of `_`)
      `.` → `_2e_`   (hex of `.`, applied after the `_` pass)

    With this scheme:
      `foo`            → `foo`
      `foo_bar`        → `foo_5f_bar`
