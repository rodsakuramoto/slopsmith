## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Lyrics Karaoke plugin** — end-to-end karaoke setup for Sloppak songs in one workflow. The setup screen shows a per-song checklist (vocals stem / synced lyrics / per-syllable pitch) and a single "Build Karaoke" button that runs whatever's missing: Whisper alignment of pasted lyric text against the vocals stem, then `librosa.pyin` pitch extraction. Both artifacts persist inside the Sloppak (`lyrics.json`, `vocal_pitch.json`). In the player, a "Karaoke" toggle swaps the text-lyrics overlay for a horizontal pitch ribbon (one bar per syllable, vertically positioned by pitch, sweeping playhead).
- Settings export/import (#113). Two buttons on the Settings page bundle server config, browser localStorage, and opted-in plugin server-side files into a single versioned JSON file for backup, migration, or sharing a calibrated setup. Server-side import is all-or-nothing for safety-critical failures: phase-1 validates the entire bundle (schema, path-traversal, encoding) before any disk writes; phase-2 commits each file via temp+rename. Plugin-state mismatches between export and import are handled leniently: files referenced for a plugin that isn't loaded are skipped with a warning, files referenced for a plugin whose manifest no longer declares them are skipped with a warning, and localStorage is merged (not cleared) so first-run defaults from plugins installed after the export are preserved. Path-traversal, absolute paths, schema mismatch, and decode failures remain hard refusals. Plugins opt their server-side files in by declaring `settings.server_files` in `plugin.json` (list of relpaths under `CONFIG_DIR`; trailing `/` denotes a directory).
- Library filtering by parts present or missing (#129, #69). New right-side Filters drawer (single button next to the format/sort row, with active-filter count badge and dismissible chips below) lets you require or exclude arrangements (Lead/Rhythm/Bass/Combo), specific stems on Sloppaks (drums/bass/vocals/piano/other), lyrics, and tuning. Multi-select within an axis is OR (Lead OR Rhythm); cross-axis is AND. State persists across reloads. New endpoint `GET /api/library/tuning-names` returns distinct tunings present in the library, ordered by musical distance.
- Sort library by year (#128). Two new options in the sort dropdown: "Year (newest)" and "Year (oldest)". Songs without a year are pushed to the bottom for both directions.

### Changed
- Tuning sort is now ordered by musical distance from E Standard (#22) instead of alphabetical: E Standard first, then Drop D / F Standard at distance 2, then Eb Standard / F# Standard at distance 6, etc. Matches Rocksmith's grouping. Within a magnitude tier, down-tuned variants come before up-tuned, then alphabetical.
- Settings page restructured into separate "Slopsmith" (core) and "Plugins" sections, with each plugin's settings rendered as a collapsible panel (collapsed by default). "Plugin Updates" moved into the Plugins section.
- **Lyrics Sync** is now a redirect stub. Its alignment + save endpoints moved into the new Lyrics Karaoke plugin alongside the pitch extraction. Existing nav entries and bookmarks land on a "moved" page that auto-redirects to the merged plugin.

### Migration notes
- The library filters depend on three new columns (`stem_ids`, `tuning_name`, `tuning_sort_key`) that are populated as songs are scanned. If filters look empty after upgrading, run **Settings → Full Rescan** to repopulate; alternatively the periodic background rescan picks them up over time.
