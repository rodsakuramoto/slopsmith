// Issue #686 — a Screen Wake Lock is held only while a song plays so the OS
// screensaver doesn't kick in during windowed-mode playback. We stub
// navigator.wakeLock before app.js runs (headless Chromium rejects a real
// 'screen' request — there is no display) and drive the song:* bus events the
// wake-lock helper listens to. `held` flips true only once a request actually
// resolves and the lock is kept, so the fast play→pause race is observable.
