"""WhisperX-based lyric transcription for vocal stems.

Acts as a fallback path when a PSARC has no vocals XML/SNG, or when the
user runs `transcribe_existing_sloppak()` on a sloppak that lacks
`lyrics.json`. Operates on an already-isolated vocal stem (the Demucs
`vocals.ogg` produced by `split_sloppak_stems`) — does NOT separate
vocals from a mixed track; that's the caller's responsibility.

Output shape matches `_parse_lyrics()` in `sloppak_convert.py` and the
on-disk `lyrics.json` shape documented at `docs/sloppak-spec.md` §2.3:

    [{"t": float, "d": float, "w": str}, ...]

`t` and `d` are seconds. `w` carries a `-` suffix when it joins to the
following syllable; a bare `+` syllable marks a line break. WhisperX
emits words, not syllables; the mapper inserts `+` line breaks on
segment-gap heuristics and otherwise lets each word stand as its own
syllable.

Engine selection
────────────────
Two transcription paths share a common output:

* `transcribe_vocals_remote(path, server_url, ...)` — POST the vocal
  stem to the `/align` endpoint on a slopsmith-demucs-server (Byron's
  reference server already hosts WhisperX alongside Demucs at the same
  URL). Mirrors `_run_demucs_remote()` in `sloppak_convert.py`.

* `transcribe_vocals_local(path, ...)` — load WhisperX in-process. Heavy
  (~3 GB of model weights for `large-v2` + the wav2vec2 aligner) and
  slow on CPU. Deferred imports of `whisperx`, `torch`, and `soundfile`
  keep the rest of slopsmith free of those dependencies — same pattern
  Demucs uses in `sloppak_convert.py:demucs_available()`.

The caller (`_maybe_transcribe_lyrics` in `sloppak_convert.py`) picks
between them based on the converter's `whisperx.server_url` config and
falls back as appropriate. This module does not read config — both
entry points are pure functions of their arguments.

Hallucination mitigation
────────────────────────
Whisper invents plausible-sounding lyrics on near-silent or purely
instrumental input. Two gates guard against that:

1. `vocals_has_signal(path, threshold)` — cheap RMS check before
   inference. Skips songs where the vocal stem is below threshold
   (Demucs returns near-silent vocals for instrumentals).

2. `min_word_score` post-filter — WhisperX's word alignment emits a
   per-word confidence score; words below the threshold are dropped
   from the output. Default 0.35 matches the value the reference
   TabGrabber prototype settled on.
