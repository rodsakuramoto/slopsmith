"""PSARC → sloppak conversion + stem splitting.

This module is the single source of truth for the convert + split pipelines.
Both the CLI scripts (`scripts/psarc_to_sloppak.py`, `scripts/split_stems.py`)
and the in-app converter plugin (`plugins/sloppak_converter`) import from
here — see the plugin's `routes.py` for the job queue that wraps these
functions with progress reporting.

Each function accepts a `progress_cb(fraction: float, stage: str, message: str)`
callback that the job queue forwards to the client over a WebSocket.

    Directory mtime on its own is not a reliable activity signal —

    """Sweep `tempfile.gettempdir()` of orphaned `s2p_*` staging dirs left
    behind by killed conversions.

    Each convert / split routine in this module wraps its work in a
    `tempfile.mkdtemp` / `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` whose prefix
    starts with `_TEMP_DIR_PREFIX` (the per-routine prefixes are the
    specific strings `s2p_extract_`, `s2p_work_`, `s2p_wem_`,
    `s2p_split_`, and `s2p_split_zip_` — the shared `s2p_` head is
    what we match against here so a single sweep covers them all).
    Cleanup of those dirs relies on a `finally` / context-manager
    `__exit__`. Those guarantees do NOT hold if the host process is
    SIGKILL'd (Docker shutdown timeout, OOM kill, `docker compose
    restart` while a job is mid-flight), and the dirs accumulate
    forever. A bulk-convert run that's restarted a few times can
    leave many GB of leftover PSARC extractions under `/tmp` on a
    long-lived container.

    Intended to be called once at host startup, BEFORE any new
    conversion runs in *this* process. Note that startup of this
    process does NOT guarantee filesystem exclusivity:

    - A second slopsmith instance can share `tempfile.gettempdir()`
      (containers writing to a host-mounted `/tmp`, two instances
      run on the same workstation, rolling-restart deployments
      where the old and new processes overlap briefly).
    - An external cleanup pass (cron `tmpwatch`, container init
      hooks) can race with this one.

    `min_age_seconds` is the safety knob for that. The "age" signal
    is the most recent mtime found anywhere inside the staging dir
    (recursive walk), NOT the top-level dir's own mtime — directory
    mtime only advances when direct children are created / removed
    / renamed, so a long Demucs run that writes under
    `s2p_split_xxx/htdemucs_6s/track/` would leave the top dir's
    own mtime stale even while the job is actively writing.
    Recursive `rglob` over a staging dir is cheap (~tens to a few
    hundred files for a real conversion) and gives us a reliable
    "any descendant touched within the threshold" gate.

    Pass a value safely larger than the longest stretch of "no
    visible writes anywhere in the tree" a live conversion might
    have. Server startup hands in 900s (15 minutes), which covers
    the remote Demucs polling window (up to 10 minutes with no
    file writes while the server-side job runs) plus margin for
    upload and download time. For local Demucs / PSARC / WEM
    routines that write continuously, the recursive mtime check
    keeps active dirs alive regardless of threshold.
    The default of 0 is appropriate only for callers who can prove
    filesystem exclusivity (e.g. test harnesses with isolated
    `tmp_path` fixtures).

    For truly hostile shared-`/tmp` environments, the safer answer
    is a per-instance temp root (override via `TMPDIR`); this

    The sloppak format allows `manifest.yaml: lyrics: <any-relpath>`

    `source_dir / lyrics.json` — that misses manifests pointing at
    `lyrics/karaoke.json` or similar. Reads the manifest, resolves
    the `lyrics` key against `source_dir` with the same
    relative-to(source_dir) safety check the sloppak loader uses
    (lib/sloppak.py), and returns the path only when the file
    actually exists on disk and has a `.json` suffix.

    Checks are deliberately surface-level: regular file + `.json`
    extension only. The function does NOT parse the JSON or validate
    that it contains the expected list-of-syllables shape — that
    validation lives in the sloppak loader and would double the cost
    of the gate (read + parse) for no win. A `.json` file that turns
    out to be malformed at load time is the loader's problem; for
    the transcribe gate's purposes, the presence of *any* manifest-
    declared JSON is enough to defer to the user instead of silently

         callers may not).

         users who ran the stems splitter without `transcribe_lyrics=True`.

      2. Sloppak only has `stems/full.ogg` (never split) — delegate

         Demucs-splits and transcribes in one pass. Leaves the other
